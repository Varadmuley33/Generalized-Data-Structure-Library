Generalised Data Structures Library
--------------------------------------------------------
ProjectName : Created self data structures.

Technology: C++ Programming

  Author: Varad Nitin Muley

Project Overview
--------------------------------------------------------
This project is a C++ library of generic data structures that 
provides object-oriented implementations of both linear 
and non-linear data structures.

It offers ready-to-use functionalities for both fundamental 
and advanced operations. The library is designed using 
templates so that it can be reused with any data type.

The implementation follows OOP principles such as encapsulation, 
modularity, and extensibility, making it suitable for both 
academic learning and real-world application development.

Key Features
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Linear Data Structures:
   - Singly Linear Linked List
   - Singly Circular Linked List
   - Doubly Linear Linked List
   - Doubly Circular Linked List
   - Stack (LIFO)
   - Queue (FIFO)

2. Non-Linear Data Structures:
   - Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert, delete, 
     and traversal operations

3. Algorithms:
   - Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
   - Sorting: Bubble Sort, Efficient Bubble Sort, 
     Selection Sort, Insertion Sort

4. Generic Implementation:
   - Uses C++ templates for type independence
   - Same implementation works for integers, floats, 
     strings, and custom objects

5. Library Format:
   - Designed as a reusable C++ library that can be 
     linked with client applications

Learning Outcomes
--------------------------------------------------------
- Mastery of C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Strong foundation in linear and non-linear data structures
- Implementation of generic programming with templates
- Practical knowledge of searching and sorting algorithms
- Experience in designing reusable libraries for software development

Motivation & Problem Statement
--------------------------------------------------------
Every computer science student and software developer repeatedly needs to implement and use data 
structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and sorting/searching algorithms.

While C++ already provides the STL (Standard Template Library), many learners find it difficult to understand
because of its abstract syntax and lack of visibility into internal implementations.

Thus, this project solves two main problems:

1. Educational Purpose → Helping learners understand the internal working of data structures by implementing them from scratch.

2. Practical Purpose → Providing a reusable, generic library that can be easily linked with other projects (like STL).
